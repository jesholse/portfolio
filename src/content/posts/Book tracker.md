The purpose of this site is to track books I've read and the focus are on books either by authors or books that play out in the northern Sweden. Books by the so called proletarian authors are also occurring frequently. The search function for finding books is at this moment not added. It'll soon be added with the use of <ins>[HTMX](https://htmx.org/)</ins>. A search function with the use of HTMX is demonstrated on <ins>[simplified pagination](/projects/simplified-pagination)</ins>
