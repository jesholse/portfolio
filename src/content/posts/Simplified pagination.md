This is a prototype for how a custom blog could be created through the help of a content folder, pagination and transitions. The purpose is mainly to demonstrate functionality.

Our page uses an inbuild content mangement system. It has a folder called 'content' and inside the folder we'll put markdown files. These markdown files are later converted into blog entries. A downside with this approach is that those markdown files have to be created locally. This means that whoever adding entries need to have some kind of knowledge of markdown syntax and deploying.

Another approach is to use an external content mangement system such as WordPress. I've here created an example with WordPress which basically works the same for the end user (user visiting the site) but differs for any person responsibility for content. For a layman WordPress is an axcellent choice for content mangement.
