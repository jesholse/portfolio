This site utilize a WordPress API which means that the site can use WordPress as a content management system. The site itself uses Astro.js as frontend architecture. This means that we'll dynamically create new pages every time an entry is addded through WordPress contrary to using the inbuilt content folder which generates pages when the site is deployed. 

It's possible to display comments, post comments and filter by category and everything that can be done on a regular WordPress site with the exception of plugins - which of course can be substituted with custom made code. Everything can then be regulated within WordPress just as a normal WordPress site.

The downfall with using two separate systems - headless WordPress and a frontend - is that they've to be hosted on two different servers. The positive side is that it's possibility to 100% customize the frontend.

The site at this moments lacks a search function, filtering by category and comments. These functions will be added. A seach function is demonstrated on <ins>[Simplified blog](https://jolly-granita-4e8b2d.netlify.app/)
